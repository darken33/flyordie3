designed with Gw-Basic graphics functions, and sound was only internal, it ran under a Commodore 
PC 10-III (320×200, 4 colors and 4.7 MHz).

“Fly Or Die 2” was developed in 1997, and was written in Turbo Pascal with ASM routines. Graphics 
were a little bit better with external sprite (rendered with P.O.V.), musics were under MOD format. 
It could run on a PC DX2 80 (320×200, 256 colors and 88Mhz).

And now “Fly Or Die 3” in 2016, written under Unity, with 3D models from Blender and Graphics designed
